#FileSystem

1. Write a syncronouse function called mkFileIn("data" , ...listOfFolders) that creates a file with the given data. The file name should be the last element in listOfFolders. The element in listOfFOlders should describe a path relative to the location of the file containing such functionality - Do not make it recursive

2. Write a syncronouse function called allFilesInPath(path) that takes a path and returns the names (not the path) all the files (not Directories) in each of its sub directories - Do not make it recursive. The path given can both be absolute and relative

3. Write a syncronouse function called deleteAllFiles(fileType) that deletes all files that end with the given filetype. If a directory is present it should try to delete all the files in the subdirectory aswell - Do not make it recursive.

4. Write a syncronouse function called deleteAllFileslike(fileType) that deletes all files that end with the given filetype. If a directory is present it should try to delete all the files in the subdirectory aswell - Do not make it recursive


##NOTES

1. All functionalities here should be syncronous!
2. Test for exercise 2,3 & 4 depend on solution 1; so work on that one first :)
